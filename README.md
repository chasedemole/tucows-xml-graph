# Tucows XML Graph Project
This repo parses an XML file into a Graph struct, then takes JSON string input to find the cheapest path between two nodes or compiles all of the paths between two nodes.

## Testing
This repo contains a test.xml file with sample graph data, a sample query JSON object and the expected outcome of those queries. To run, execute the following:
```
go build .
go run tucows-graph
```
